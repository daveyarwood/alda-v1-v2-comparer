= Alda v1 vs. v2 output comparison tool

== Background

This is a tool that parses a score written for Alda v1, using both Alda v1 and
v2, and outputs the offset, duration, and pitch of every note in the score in a
standard format so that the two outputs can be diff'd. The goal is to ensure
that if you play an Alda v1 score with Alda v2, the note timing won't be
unexpectedly different.

== Notes

* This tool includes the relevant Alda code repositories as submodules and uses
the latest commit on the right development branches (`master` for Alda v1,
`v2` for Alda v2).

* Alda v2 is mostly backwards compatible with Alda v1, with the exception of
inline Clojure code, which is no longer supported. Alda v2 does have an inline
Lisp that serves the same function, but the Lisp syntax is different from
Clojure, so some Alda v1 scores need to be adjusted. This tool makes the
necessary adjustments before parsing the score using Alda v2.

== Usage

**TODO**

== TODO

* Comparison script that takes a single filename
* Comparison script accepts multiple filenames on STDIN
** Run the v1 outputter in a persistent process to side-step long Clojure
start-up time
* GitHub Alda score finder?
